# Fundamentals-of-Visualization-with-Tableau
```
Data Visualization or Data Viz => is how we communicate numerical or quantitative information
in a visual manner

*** Measure Names 
Sheet1...n(Count) => Number of records

*** SUM(Number of Records) in Windows Tableau
*** CNT(Sheet1...n) in Mac Tableau

*** To combine all charts and graphs that you have created to one visualization,
a Dashboard is required for that.

*** This is so important for colored differentiated graphs:
if you want to create graphs with different colors, then simply drag the item from the
Tables section to the detail option and it will create colored, differentiated graphs!!!

*** A grain of data = A row of data
